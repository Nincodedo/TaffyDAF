What does TaffyDAF do?

Where does this need to be(Server/Client)?
This needs to be setup on the Server. Client side is not needed, however, a client may have the mod in the folder(it should do nothing).

Config Options:
Set which Dim ID to target(Default is the Overworld). If set differently, set it to a dim that is loaded.

Can I use this in a pack?
Have at it.
